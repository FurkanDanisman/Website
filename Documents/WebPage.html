                <h3>Thoughts about myself</h3>
                
                    <p class="justified-text"> 
                        I am a Research Assistant at the Bank of Canada. In this lifetime, I have been fortunate to explore a wide range of fields, all through the lens of a discipline I deeply respect, statistics. 
                        This tool has allowed me to contribute to research in sociology, space engineering, healthcare analytics, applied and theoretical statistics, sports analytics, and now, economics at Canada’s central bank.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="justified-text">
                        I am profoundly grateful to those who have given me opportunities to explore, think, and grow. I enjoy discovering new ideas, learning from diverse perspectives, and questioning the nature of reality. 
                        I have goals, dreams, and questions, some of which may take a lifetime to answer. In this pursuit, I am willing to dedicate my time, my energy, and perhaps, my sanity. I find meaning in reading and listening to discussions on psychology, philosophy, and history. 
                        My favorite book is <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius, a work so timeless that the reflections of a Roman emperor, written nearly two millennia ago, still resonate with a silly Turkish kid today. My favorite podcaster is Lex Fridman, whose curiosity and humility inspire me.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="justified-text">
                        My research interests lie in large language models (LLMs) and causality. One of the fundamental questions that intrigues me is: Can we truly replicate human understanding in artificial systems? 
                        Does intelligence in a model require genuine comprehension, or is it enough for it to simply convince us that it understands? If we cannot distinguish between the two, does the distinction even matter? 
                        And if one day these systems claim consciousness, do they need to truly be conscious, or is it enough for us to simply believe they are? Beyond the technical questions, it is essential to consider the societal impact of these advancements—perhaps even more important than the answers themselves.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="justified-text">
                        I welcome conversations from all disciplines and would be grateful to exchange ideas with anyone curious enough to reach out. And for those who wonder—my name is pronounced "Four-cun." 
                        It’s not difficult, just unfamiliar.
