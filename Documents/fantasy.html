        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        
        <p> 
            I am a research assistant at the Bank of Canada. In this lifetime, I have been fortunate enough to research various topics using a tool-kit, I am lucky to be familiar with, which is statistics.
            Statistics helped me work on sociology, space engineering, healthcare analytics, applied and theoretical statistics, sports analytics, and now economics at the central bank of Canada.
            
            I am grateful for everyone who provided me these opportunities. I like exploring ideas and learning from different perspectives. I have goals, dreams, and questions that I want to answer.
            In this pursuit, I am willing to invest hours, days, years, my life, and perhaps, my mind. I like reading and listening podcasts about psychology, philosophy, and history. My favorite 
            book is Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and my favorite podcaster is Lex Fridman.

            My research interests are on LLM and causality. One of the questions that I particularly one to tackle is, "Can we replicate the human understanding or intelligence one models?", "Does 
            the model need to be intelligent or convince humans to be intelligent, if we can not detect it does it matter? Does it matter if they are become concious or convincing us, humans that 
            they are concious?"

            I am an easy person to reach out. From all disciplines, I would be happy, and grateful to be talk with you. Those who wonder, my name is pronounced as Four-cun. It's really not hard, just unfamiliar.
