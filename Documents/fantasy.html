            <h3>Thoughts about myself</h3>
            
            <p> 
                I am a research assistant at the Bank of Canada. In this lifetime, I have been fortunate enough to research various topics using a tool-kit I am lucky to be familiar with, which is statistics.
                Statistics helped me work on sociology, space engineering, healthcare analytics, applied and theoretical statistics, sports analytics, and now economics at the central bank of Canada.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am grateful for everyone who provided me these opportunities. I like exploring ideas and learning from different perspectives. I have goals, dreams, and questions that I want to answer.
                In this pursuit, I am willing to invest hours, days, years, my life, and perhaps, my mind. I like reading and listening to podcasts about psychology, philosophy, and history. My favorite 
                book is <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius, and my favorite podcaster is Lex Fridman.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My research interests are on LLM and causality. One of the questions that I particularly want to tackle is, "Can we replicate human understanding or intelligence in models?", "Does 
                the model need to be intelligent or just convince humans that it is intelligent? If we cannot detect it, does it matter? Does it matter if they become conscious or just convince us, humans, 
                that they are conscious?" Of course, while trying to answer these questions, it is important to consider its effects on society—maybe more important than the answer itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am an easy person to reach out to. From all disciplines, I would be happy and grateful to talk with you. For those who wonder, my name is pronounced as "Four-cun." It’s really not hard, just unfamiliar.
            </p>
